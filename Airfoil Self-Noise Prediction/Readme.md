## Introduction
This project aims to predict scaled sound pressure levels of an airfoil using machine learning techniques. Predicting noise levels is crucial in designing quieter aircraft and assessing environmental impact.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Frequency
- Attack angle
- Chord length
- Free-stream velocity
- Suction side displacement thickness
- Scaled sound pressure (target variable)

The dataset was sourced from [provide source if available] and contains [mention number of records and features].

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:
- Loading the dataset and assigning column names
- Checking for missing values (our dataset has no missing values)
- Exploring the correlation between features and target variable

## Modeling
In consideration of the non-linear relationship between features and the target, we opted for the **Random Forest Regressor** algorithm.

## Evaluation
We evaluated our model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a validation set. The model outperformed the baseline, indicating its effectiveness in noise prediction.

## Results
The important features for noise prediction identified by our model include [mention important features]. The model has been saved for future use.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting airfoil noise levels. The results highlight the importance of feature engineering and model selection in achieving accurate predictions.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
