## Introduction
This project aims to predict airfare prices using machine learning techniques. Airfare prediction can help travelers make informed decisions and save money by booking flights at optimal times.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:
- Departure and arrival locations
- Flight duration
- Airline
- Time of booking
- Date and time of departure and arrival
- Number of stops

The dataset was sourced from [provide source if available] and contains [mention number of records and features].

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting day of the week, month, etc. from date features)

## Modeling
Several machine learning models were implemented and compared, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model.

## Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²)

The performance of each model was compared based on these metrics.

## Results
The best-performing model was [mention the best model] with an MAE of [mention MAE] and an R² of [mention R²].

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict airfare prices. The results show that [mention key findings, such as the most important features or insights gained from the model].


## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
